How To Install
==============

1. Install **AppAPI** from the [Appstore](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/app_api).
2. Create a deployment daemon following the [instructions](https://cloud-py-api.github.io/app_api/CreationOfDeployDaemon.html) provided by AppAPI. _(If you are using AIO, it will be created automatically)_
3. Navigate to the `External Apps` menu from your Nextcloud instance, find this app (`Assistant Talk Bot`) in the `Tools` category and click `Deploy and Enable`.
4. In Nextcloud Talk, choose a conversation and enable the bot in `Conversation settings`.
5. Now you can invoke the bot by typing `@assistant` followed by a prompt in the conversation (e.g. `@assistant I have a question for you.`).
